                &emsp;I am a full-time student based in Philadelphia and a part-time Software Engineer Co-op at eMoney. 
                My focus is on front-end development as I utilize React, HTML, CSS, and other front-end tools in my work at eMoney. 
                During my initial six-month co-op at the company, I also did backend work in .NET and gained experience in Drupal. <br>
                &emsp;Outside of eMoney, I have experience in open-source development as I worked under Dr. Joshua Lequieu from the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Drexel University. 
                I helped develop software tools for his research group (see fieldkit in <a href="experience.html">Experience</a>). 
                I also wrote documentation using Sphinx and set up unit tests using Github Actions for this package. <br>
                &emsp;At Drexel, I am a part of the Liberty Scholars program, a program that originally provided full-ride scholarships to 50 low-income Philadelphian high school seniors. 
                Additionally, I am a peer mentor through the Engineering Leadership Scholars program, in which I mentored first-year engineering students and took courses in mentorship and leadership. 
                I also worked as a peer tutor at the Academic Center for Engineers, helping students in introductory engineering courses such Intro to Programming for Engineers and General Chemistry. <br>
                &emsp;Outside of school and work, I enjoy trying new food around the city and hanging out with friends and family. I am raising a Pomsky puppy named Shiro (see his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shu.shiro/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>). <br>
                &emsp;My career goal is to work in web development, open-source development, or scientific software. I am open to any opportunity in and out of software engineering.
